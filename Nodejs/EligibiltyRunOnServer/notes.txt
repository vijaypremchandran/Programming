Purpose:

This application uses a form to get info on the file placed on the robin server. This app will connect to robin 
and execute the corresponding shell scripts for the eligibilty and accum process. This app can run 3 different file formats
namely X12, Cardh29 and Accum

Assumption and changes made to the cobol programs:

1) The existing cobol program has a hard stops for the user inputs and app would not be able to communicate with such user inputs. The app will
    only work when there is no user intervention. To achieve this the following changes are done to the programs.

    a) Cardhx12.cbl ==> This program stops at the end of the program to get user input (Y/N) to continue. This check has been removed.
    b) Cardh29.cbl  ==> This program gets the Batch num, Confirmation flag and system num form the user and this is not required for testing. This info
                        has been hardcoded with defualts. If there is case, we can bring all this info form the web form as well. Also as part of threshold error check, there is 
                        a hard stop when the error number is gt than 28. For testing we would like to finish the process and give us reports any way. 
2) The O/P report files are saved in the mount dir, this can be changed to mail the user as well.
3) This app is configured for robin only. In the event to have this app for the other servers. The obj dir on the shells have to change. Also the IP address and 
   Key folder has to be configured.

Use the below file names to test:
Cardh29 => TEST_VIJAY_TRMDTE.txt
X12 => ?? I have a big file and need a small one for the demo.
Accum => ?? I have a big file and need a small one for the demo.

Issues: 
1) The copy of files on the server side is making the app run slow. When we are running against the server files directly without 
   the copy which will be the ideal case, this issue will not be seen.
